# Google_Chrome_YouTube_Customizer
Simple YouTube Video Feed Customizer Addon for Google Chrome
**Rough Draft**
/**
* by Jamin Szczesny 2016

* Adds better readable channel (user) names above videos
* Combines channels videos (using scroling) with 2+ videos in a section
* Moves "Watched" videos from main video displayed (where possible)
* Adds a +#(\u2193 down arrow) notifier letting you know how many more vids there are
* Very rough for simple functionality
* Places "Watched" videos at the bottom of the queue (if there are multiple)

I was frustrated with the YouTube feed (specifically the subscriptions feed)
So I very quickly wrote this Google Chrome addon to fix it...
It works pretty well, but isn't perfect...
Feel free to join this project and improve the code or functionality.
